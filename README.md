# Azure SRE Agent GitHub Integration Test Repository

This repository serves as a testing ground for exploring and demonstrating how the Azure Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Agent can interact with GitHub repositories.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- **Test Azure SRE Agent Capabilities**: Evaluate how the Azure SRE agent can monitor, analyze, and interact with GitHub repositories
- **Explore GitHub Integration**: Understand the various ways Azure tools can integrate with GitHub workflows
- **Document Best Practices**: Capture learnings and best practices for Azure-GitHub integration scenarios
- **Prototype Automation**: Test automated workflows that bridge Azure services and GitHub operations

## What is Azure SRE Agent?

The Azure SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Agent is designed to help maintain and improve the reliability, performance, and operational efficiency of applications and infrastructure hosted on Azure. When integrated with GitHub, it can:

- Monitor repository health and activity
- Analyze code quality and security
- Automate deployment pipelines
- Provide insights into application performance
- Facilitate incident response and remediation

## Test Scenarios

This repository may be used to test various integration scenarios, including:

### 1. Repository Monitoring
- Tracking commit frequency and patterns
- Monitoring pull request workflows
- Analyzing code quality metrics
- Detecting security vulnerabilities

### 2. Automated Workflows
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated testing and deployment
- Issue and incident management
- Performance monitoring alerts

### 3. Operational Intelligence
- Correlating code changes with system performance
- Generating reliability reports
- Tracking deployment success rates
- Monitoring application health metrics
